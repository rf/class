1. We say that a system has achieved affinity if it can associate some
   resource consumer with the resources consumed.  Processor affinity refers
   to one specific instance of affinity where the resource consumer is some
   schedulable unit and the resource consumed is processor time.  Therefore,
   a scheduler can achieve processor affinity if it is able to associate one
   schedulable unit (i.e., a 'thread' or 'process') with one processor.

2. In a NUMA architecture, some cores will be 'closer' to some portions of the
   main memory; that is, the access time will be much lower.  Therefore, a
   scheduler will want to attempt to achieve processor affinity by keeping
   schedulable units on a single core or set of cores.
