<h1>third</h1>
<p><code>third</code> is a simple userland thread library. It is capable of preemptive, round
robin scheduling. It implements most of the functionality available in 
<code>pthreads</code>.

</p>
<h2>Sorting example</h2>
<p>The sorting example is called <code>test_sort.c</code> and it can be tested as such:

</p>
<p><code>
make test
./sort
</code>

</p>
<p>I had to make some minor modifications for it to work with my library, which
has a bit of a weird API.

</p>
<h2>Consistency with pthreads</h2>
<p><code>third</code> isn&#39;t completely consistent with <code>pthreads</code>. Its creation
functions return pointers to structs rather than operating on pointers to
structs. Many of the functions require the current <code>third</code> to be passed in,
which makes the implementation a little bit simpler.

</p>
<h2>Detecting whether we interrupted the scheduler</h2>
<p>Instead of using E/RIP to detect if we interrupted the scheduler, I instead
use the stack base pointer.  This is a pretty silly way of detecting whether
we interrupted the scheduler, but it does work.  Basically, I just check to see
if RBP is within 10mb of the stored RBP for the scheduler; if it I don&#39;t
preempt.

</p>
<h2>Mutexes and disabling the scheduler</h2>
<p>I have a pretty stupid way of disabling the scheduler while doing mutex
operations, in order to make them atomic. I basically just write a flag that
says &quot;don&#39;t preempt&quot;. Memory-aligned writes are atomic on x86, so this works;
but it&#39;s relatively naive.

</p>
<h2>Mailbox functionality</h2>
<p>I added a simple mailbox API to my library. It allows circular <code>box</code>es to be
created with a certain number of <code>slot</code>s. Once a slot has been read, it is
marked as such and can be used as a place for a new message. Reads and writes
to the boxes will block a <code>third</code>.
