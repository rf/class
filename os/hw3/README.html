<h1>third</h1>
<p><code>third</code> is a simple userland thread library. It is capable of preemptive, round
robin scheduling. It implements most of the functionality available in 
<code>pthreads</code>.

</p>
<h2>Mutexes and disabling the scheduler</h2>
<p>I have a pretty stupid way of disabling the scheduler while doing mutex
operations, in order to make them atomic. I basically just write a flag that
says &quot;don&#39;t preempt&quot;. Memory-aligned writes are atomic on x86, so this works;
but it&#39;s relatively naive.

<h2>Mailbox functionality</h2>
<p>I added a simple mailbox API to my library. It allows circular <code>box</code>es to be
created with a certain number of <code>slot</code>s. Once a slot has been read, it is
marked as such and can be used as a place for a new message. Reads and writes
to the boxes will block a <code>third</code>.
