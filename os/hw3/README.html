<h1>third</h1>

</p>
<p><code>third</code> is a simple userland thread library. It is capable of preemptive, round
robin scheduling. It implements most of the functionality available in 
<code>pthreads</code>.

</p>
<h2>Sorting example</h2>
<p>The sorting example is called <code>test_sort.c</code> and it can be tested as such:

</p>
<p><code>
make test
./sort
</code>

</p>
<p>I had to make some minor modifications for it to work with my library, which
has a bit of a weird API.

</p>
<h2>Sorting questions</h2>
<p>Since I didn&#39;t write the sort example myself, here are my answers to the
questions:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Well, this algorithm essentially consists of each thread trying to get a
chance to perform a swap. Once the thread was able to do a swap, we want to
now allow a different thread to swap; if we were to run around the loop
again, there would be nothing to do. So, we yield, with the hope that some
other thread will perform a swap so we don&#39;t waste time the next time we
pop around that loop.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The virtual timer I&#39;m using doesn&#39;t appear to increment when a system
call is in progress; so if that sleep is left in, I never preempt because
the interrupt is never fired.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Consistency with pthreads</h2>
<p><code>third</code> isn&#39;t completely consistent with <code>pthreads</code>. Its creation
functions return pointers to structs rather than operating on pointers to
structs. Many of the functions require the current <code>third</code> to be passed in,
which makes the implementation a little bit simpler.

</p>
<h2>Detecting whether we interrupted the scheduler</h2>
<p>Instead of using E/RIP to detect if we interrupted the scheduler, I instead
use the stack base pointer.  This is a pretty silly way of detecting whether
we interrupted the scheduler, but it does work.  Basically, I just check to see
if RBP is within 10mb of the stored RBP for the scheduler; if it I don&#39;t
preempt.

</p>
<h2>Mutexes and disabling the scheduler</h2>
<p>I have a pretty stupid way of disabling the scheduler while doing mutex
operations, in order to make them atomic. I basically just write a flag that
says &quot;don&#39;t preempt&quot;. Memory-aligned writes are atomic on x86, so this works;
but it&#39;s relatively naive.

</p>
<h2>Mailbox functionality</h2>
<p>I added a simple mailbox API to my library. It allows circular <code>box</code>es to be
created with a certain number of <code>slot</code>s. Once a slot has been read, it is
marked as such and can be used as a place for a new message. Reads and writes
to the boxes will block a <code>third</code>.

</p>
<h2>Re: extra credit COW idea</h2>
<p>I think this is a really fascinating idea. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
appropriate to implement it with a SIGSEGV handler; this sounds dangerous. Also,
it&#39;d require a pretty ugly interface to work.  Alternatively, a disassembler
could be used to perform surgery on the running code to place in a new address.

</p>
<p>It seems like this would be much safer to implement at the kernel level, where
we have the benefit of the paging hardware&#39;s translation. COW could be
implemented between threads in exactly the same way it&#39;s implemented between
processes. A new system call could be added called <code>create_cow_reference()</code> or
so which would return a new address pointing to the same data which would be
COW optimized.

</p>
<p>However, I&#39;d also argue that this is rather easy to implement by convention in
a user&#39;s program. Using my mailbox code, it&#39;s fairly easy to shuffle pointers
between two <code>third</code>s. Then, the author of said program would decree that once a
pointer is shuffled across, it is the responsibility of the receiver to deal
with it. This is heavily application dependent, though.
